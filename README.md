Answer to #15:
We created a decoder (which should be evident in the names of the files we created) with an enable to allow us to retain or update information on a clock. In other words, we have 4 bits worth of memory.

Alright, I'm taking a break from my Astro, SE, and MSS projects now that I realize this is due tomorrow. Will check in as things come up.

So... writing And_3, Inverter, and up through Step7 of CE2. All was well. No bugs, no issues. Awesome. Writing the inverter component, not awesome. Using the inerent parts of the Inverter code instead of the And-3* but otherwise the component structure looks the same. The Inverter doesn't seem to want to connect to the component call. I'm going to push past this and come back when it starts to interfere with what I still have left to do.

Ok this is getting ominous. None of the files that are supposed to be nested in the top left window are showing up.

Step 10, my comuputer is running out of battery life and I still havent solved the Inverter problem. I have the first 2 periods off tomorrow morning so I'll head back to my room and get some sleep tonight and solve this tomorrow.

So I turned on my computer this morning and auto-magically my Inverter component works and my files now show up... this thing is haunted.

I am working with the testbench and I don't know what is wrong/why it isn't working. Closed the ISE and reopened it. Now the testbench works. Like I said haunted. *@#% me there is another part to this?

Wow... behavioral coding is much easier...

Testbench... fail. Restarting ISE again.

Testbench... success... I'm currently torn. On the one hand, my code works by closing and restarting the window. On the other I have to call the Ghostbusters to fix this thing and I'm pretty sure Bill Murray retired so it will be a lot less fun and probably pretty expensive...

Do I need to comment on my upload experience? 

I feel like that should be enough.
